        <h1>Strides of Endurance</h1>
        <P><strong>In the quiet dawn before the day</strong>,<br>
            When shadows stretch in shades of gray,<br>
            A heart beats strong, though weary still,<br>
            <em>Endurance</em> wakes with iron will.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Through storms that rage and winds that howl,</strong><br>
            Through bitter nights and endless trial,<br>
            The soul stands firm, no turning back,<br>
            With faith to light the darkest track.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>Each step a battle, every breath,</strong><br>
            A whispered dance with life and death,<br>
            But in the strain, in every tear,<br>
            <em>Endurance</em> grows, defeating fear.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>For mountains move with steady hands,</strong><br>
            And oceans bow to shifting sands,<br>
            The world may break, but not the soul,<br>
            <em>Endurance</em> keeps the spirit whole.<br>
            <br>
            <strong>So rise again, no fear, no doubt,</strong><br>
            For strength is born in wearing out.<br>
            The journey long, but in the end,<br>
            <em>Endurance</em> wins, your closest friend.<br>

        </P>
